## Database Schema

### Requests Collection
```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "timestamp": "ISODate",
  "path": "string",
  "method": "string",
  "user_agent": "string",
  "query": "string",
  "body": "string",
  "remote_addr": "string",
  "blocked": "boolean",
  "reason": "string",
  "ml_prediction": "number",
  "is_plugin_blocked": "boolean",
  "features_used": ["string"],
  "tags": ["string"],
  "is_manual_block": "boolean"
}
```

### Blocked IPs Collection
```json
{
  "ip": "string",
  "unblock_time": "ISODate",
  "reason": "string",
  "blocked_at": "ISODate"
}
```

## Configuration

### Dashboard Settings
The dashboard configuration is stored in `waf_settings.json`:
```json
{
  "rate_limiting": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_requests": 2,
    "window_seconds": 60,
    "block_time": 60
  },
  "ml_model": {
    "enabled": true,
    "current_version": "v1.0.0",
    "confidence_threshold": 0.7
  },
  "plugins": {
    "block_admin": true,
    "block_ip": true,
    "block_user_agent": true
  }
}
```

### Rules Configuration
Rules are stored in `rules/rules.yaml` and can be edited through the dashboard interface.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Dashboard not loading**: Check if MongoDB is running and accessible
2. **No data showing**: Ensure the WAF is logging requests to the database
3. **Rules not saving**: Check file permissions for rules.yaml
4. **IP blocking not working**: Verify MongoDB connection and collection structure

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode by setting `debug=True` in the dashboard.py file.

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Ensure proper indexes on timestamp, remote_addr, and blocked fields
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement data retention policies for old logs

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket updates every 5 seconds
- Manual refresh available for immediate updates
- Efficient data aggregation for statistics

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Dashboard should be protected behind authentication
- Consider IP whitelisting for dashboard access
- Log all dashboard actions for audit purposes

### Data Protection
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate IP addresses before blocking
- Implement rate limiting for dashboard API endpoints

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- User authentication and role-based access control
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Export functionality for reports and logs
- Integration with external security tools
- Real-time threat intelligence feeds
- Automated response actions
- Custom alerting and notifications

### API Extensions
- RESTful API for external integrations
- Webhook support for real-time notifications
- GraphQL endpoint for flexible data queries
- Bulk operations for IP management
