#  AI Web Application Firewall (WAF) Project

This is the basic structure of the firewall project we will be working on.  
*The data files used to train the RandomForest model are not yet added due to size constraints.*

  
##  Setup Instructions
Please install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` before running the project.


##  How to Run the Project
### ðŸ”¹ Run the Backend App

```bash
cd backend_app
python app.py

### ðŸ”¹ Run the WAF

```bash
cd waf
python app.py


#  Server Info
Both servers will run on localhost for now.

All incoming requests will be logged to a MongoDB server running locally.

Please make sure MongoDB is running on your machine before testing â€” either using MongoDB Compass or the terminal.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `http://localhost:5000`                                                   | Should show: `"Welcome to the REAL backend!"`                                 |
| `http://localhost:5000/search`                                            | Should show: `"Search endpoint reached"`                                      |
| `http://localhost:5000/login -d "username=admin' OR 1=1 --&password=123"` | Should return **403 Forbidden** due to WAF blocking the SQL injection attempt |

# Note
Ensure that MongoDB is running on localhost before starting the project.

All requests (allowed or blocked) are logged to MongoDB for further analysis.
